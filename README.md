# Global Food Waste Analysis & Visualization

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global food waste patterns using data-driven visualizations. It examines sectoral contributions, regional disparities, and clustering insights to identify key trends and inform sustainable waste reduction strategies. The findings aim to support policymakers and stakeholders in making data-driven decisions to minimize food waste.

## Key Findings
- Household waste is the largest contributor, particularly in affluent regions.
- Retail waste is significant in regions with inefficient supply chains.
- Food service waste is high in areas with large hospitality sectors.
- Clustering analysis identifies distinct food waste patterns among major contributors.
- Correlation analysis highlights systemic inefficiencies in food waste generation.

## Data & Methodology
### Data Sources
- United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
- World Population Review
- Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
- Research studies on food waste quantification

### Analytical Techniques
- Bar charts and treemaps to visualize sectoral contributions
- Global maps highlighting top food waste contributors
- Pair plots comparing food waste across regions
- Heatmaps analyzing correlations between waste types
- K-Means clustering to segment countries by food waste patterns
- Radar charts for regional disparities in food waste

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Required libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Plotly

## Results & Visualizations
- **Bar chart**: Sectoral contributions to food waste
- **World map**: Food waste distribution by country
- **Correlation heatmap**: Relationships between different waste types
- **K-Means clustering plot**: Segmentation of countries based on food waste levels

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights key global trends in food waste, emphasizing the need for region-specific policies and global cooperation. Recommendations include consumer education, supply chain optimizations, and improved waste management in the retail and food service sectors.
